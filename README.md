Build Applications for the Aerospace Industry with the Aircraft Exterior Defect API


General Description:
The Aircraft Exterior Defect API empowers developers to build cutting-edge applications for the aerospace industry.
By harnessing the capabilities of computer vision and machine learning, this API enables efficient and accurate detection, analysis, and management of exterior defects on aircraft, ultimately enhancing safety, maintenance procedures, and overall operational excellence. With the Aircraft Exterior Defect API, developers can integrate sophisticated defect detection algorithms into their applications. This allows for the automatic identification and categorization of various types of exterior defects, such as scratches, dents, corrosion, paint irregularities, and other imperfections on the aircraft's surface.

Novelty / Uniqueness:
Using AI for aircraft defect detection is an innovative and promising approach to improve aviation safety and maintenance practices. AI can help analyze vast amounts of data quickly and accurately, enabling early detection of potential issues, reducing downtime, and enhancing overall operational efficiency.
Here are some ideas for using AI in aircraft defect detection:
The minor defect detection is done without the need of manual inspection.
Predicting the defects before occurrence helps to maintain and prevent the damage conditions of aircraft. This also helps in the reduction of risk factors in the aircraft.
Identification of the images as fault and correct by analyzing the image data.
We create a database to efficiently store and manage information related to inspections conducted on various defects of aircraft.

Business / Social Impact:
    The proper maintenance of aircraft can also improve the working efficiency of aircraft.
    It leads to new technological innovations in the aircraft industry.
    By identifying and fixing the aircraft exterior defects it reduces the cost.
    Detecting and repairing these issues can lead to a reduction in noise pollution for both passengers and people living near airports.

Technology Architecture:
Python, Object detection using YOLO V3, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Advance AI Models, IBM Watson Studio, IBM cloud.

Scope of the Work:
Identification of the images as fault and correct by analysing the image data. This in return results in the identification of defects in aircraft through image analysis. A Database for inspection record is designed to efficiently store and manage information related to inspections conducted on various defects. The purpose of this database is to ensure compliance with the regulations, maintain safety standards and tracked the condition of inspected items. This table will be the central component of the database, holding information about each inspection conducted. It should include fields like inspection date, inspector's name, inspection type (e.g., safety, quality, and compliance), outcome (pass/fail), and any additional remarks or observations.
